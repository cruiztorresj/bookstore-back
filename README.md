# bookstore-back

Self-imposed exercise in which I try to sort of migrate a project to the new JakartaEE 10, the original project has been written using JavaEE 7.

The training is available at Pluralsight as JavaEE 7: Getting Started.

Please don't take this repository too seriously, there are a lot of places in which you'd really want to add validations on null references, etc.
